# Carbazi

Carbazi is a simple Unity game project that lets you drive a car, honk its horn, and turn on its lights when it's in a tunnel.

## Requirements

To run Carbazi, you need to have Unity version 2020.3.23f1 or later installed on your computer. You can download Unity from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

## Features

Carbazi has some features that make it fun and realistic:

- The car has a physics-based movement system that responds to collisions and terrain.
- The car has a sound system that plays honking sounds.
- The car has a light system that automatically turns on when it enters a tunnel and off when it exits.
